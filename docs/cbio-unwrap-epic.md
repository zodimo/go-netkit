<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

**Template**: feature-enhancement-epic-v1  
**Created**: 2024-01-15  
**Output**: docs/cbio-unwrap-epic.md  

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Analysis Source
- **Source Type**: IDE-based analysis
- **Project Access**: Full codebase access with existing cbio package implementation
- **Documentation Status**: cbio/README.md exists, comprehensive interface documentation available

### Current Project State

**Project Purpose**: Go NetKit is a lightweight Go library for building network transport layers with middleware support and callback-style I/O operations.

**Current Architecture**: 
- Transport layer using callback-style cbio interfaces (cbio.Reader, cbio.Writer, cbio.Closer, etc.)
- Middleware chain support for processing network operations
- Context-aware operations with proper cancellation and timeout support
- Thread-safe implementation with synchronization primitives
- Resource management with proper cleanup
- **Existing WrapReadWriteCloser**: Already provides io.ReadWriteCloser → cbio.ReadWriteCloser conversion

**Technology Stack**:
- **Language**: Go 1.24.3
- **Core Dependencies**: Standard library (context, sync, io, net, time)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Callback-driven transport handlers
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with mocks

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ Helper Function Addition (Reverse Direction)

**Enhancement Description**: 
Add a helper function to unwrap `cbio.ReadWriteCloser` instances back into standard `io.ReadWriteCloser` interfaces, enabling seamless integration when callback-style cbio instances need to be used with code expecting standard Go I/O interfaces. This unwrapper will provide synchronous operation handling while maintaining compatibility with existing standard library expectations.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ Low Impact (isolated helper function)
- Single helper function addition with no breaking changes
- Complements existing WrapReadWriteCloser function
- Enables bidirectional interoperability between standard I/O and cbio interfaces
- Provides integration path for using cbio instances with standard library code

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Provide seamless interoperability between `cbio.ReadWriteCloser` and `io.ReadWriteCloser`
- Enable integration of cbio instances with standard library code and third-party packages
- Maintain all standard io interface capabilities (synchronous operations, standard error handling)
- Ensure thread-safe operation with proper resource management
- Complement existing WrapReadWriteCloser for bidirectional conversion

**Background Context**:

The go-netkit library provides `WrapReadWriteCloser` to convert from standard `io.ReadWriteCloser` to callback-style `cbio.ReadWriteCloser`. However, there are scenarios where cbio instances need to be used with standard library code or third-party libraries that expect `io.ReadWriteCloser` interfaces. An unwrapper function would complete the bidirectional interoperability and enable cbio instances to be used anywhere standard I/O is expected.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: Helper function `UnwrapReadWriteCloser(rwc cbio.ReadWriteCloser) io.ReadWriteCloser` must be implemented in the cbio package.

**FR2**: The unwrapper must implement all io.ReadWriteCloser interface methods (Read, Write, Close) with synchronous behavior.

**FR3**: Read operations must block until completion and return standard (n int, err error) results.

**FR4**: Write operations must block until completion and return standard (n int, err error) results.

**FR5**: Close operations must be synchronous and return standard error results.

**FR6**: All operations must handle cbio callback patterns and convert them to synchronous returns.

**FR7**: The unwrapper must handle all error scenarios from the underlying cbio.ReadWriteCloser appropriately.

**FR8**: Cancellation support through context should be available via optional parameters or methods.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: The unwrapper must maintain thread safety for concurrent operations on the underlying cbio.ReadWriteCloser.

**NFR2**: Memory usage must be minimal with proper cleanup of goroutines and channels used for synchronization.

**NFR3**: Performance overhead must be minimal, with synchronization not exceeding 10% of operation time.

**NFR4**: All operations must handle timeouts gracefully and provide proper error responses.

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: **No Breaking Changes** - The helper function is additive and maintains full compatibility.

**CR2**: **Standard Library Compatibility** - Must implement io.ReadWriteCloser interface contract exactly.

**CR3**: **cbio Interface Compatibility** - Must work with any implementation of cbio.ReadWriteCloser.

**CR4**: **Context Integration Compatibility** - Should integrate properly with Go context patterns for cancellation.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Go 1.24.3  
**Frameworks**: Standard library only (context, sync, io, net, time)  
**Database**: N/A  
**Infrastructure**: Library package, no runtime infrastructure  
**External Dependencies**: None (standard library only)  

### Integration Approach

**API Integration Strategy**: Add helper function to cbio package with consistent naming and patterns  
**Testing Integration Strategy**: Add comprehensive tests covering all interface methods and error scenarios  
**Documentation Integration Strategy**: Update cbio/README.md with unwrapper function documentation and examples  

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Add unwrapper implementation to cbio package, likely in wrapper.go file alongside existing WrapReadWriteCloser  
**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing Go conventions, use descriptive names like `UnwrapReadWriteCloser`  
**Coding Standards**: Follow existing project patterns, maintain consistency with cbio package style  
**Documentation Standards**: Comprehensive GoDoc comments with usage examples  

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- Goroutine leaks if synchronization channels are not properly cleaned up
- Deadlocks if callback handlers block indefinitely
- Resource leaks if underlying cbio.ReadWriteCloser is not properly closed

**Integration Risks**:
- Inconsistent behavior compared to native io implementations
- Performance overhead from callback-to-synchronous conversion
- Blocking behavior may not be suitable for all use cases

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive testing with concurrent operations and timeout scenarios
- Proper channel lifecycle management with timeout handling
- Resource leak testing and cleanup verification
- Performance benchmarking against native io implementations

## Epic Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single focused epic with rationale

This enhancement should be structured as a single epic because:
1. It's a focused helper function with clear scope and boundaries
2. All components are related to the same interoperability concern
3. Implementation is straightforward with well-defined requirements
4. Testing and documentation are directly related to the single function

## Epic 1: cbio to io ReadWriteCloser Unwrapper Implementation

- Maintain thread safety for concurrent operations
- Provide proper resource cleanup and synchronization management
- Ensure consistent behavior with native io implementations
- Support timeout and cancellation patterns
