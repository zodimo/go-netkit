# Story 1.3: Examples, Tests, and Documentation Completion

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status
✅ Complete

## Story
**As a** library user,  
**I want** comprehensive examples, tests, and documentation for the callback-style I/O patterns,  
**so that** I can effectively migrate to and utilize the new asynchronous interface capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC1**: examples/demo1/main.go demonstrates callback-style I/O usage with proper error handling

**AC2**: All integration tests in integration_test.go use cbio interfaces and pass successfully

**AC3**: All unit tests across transport_test.go, middleware_test.go use cbio mocks and verify callback behavior

**AC4**: README.md provides complete migration guide with before/after examples

**AC5**: cbio/README.md documents all interface patterns, options, and best practices

**AC6**: Zero occurrences of standard io.Reader, io.Writer, io.Closer, io.ReadCloser, io.WriteCloser, io.ReadWriteCloser remain in codebase, except transportActor and FromReaderWriteCloser as that is its purpose and also mmockReadWriteCloser for testing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story depends on completion of Stories 1.1 and 1.2, which provide the foundation cbio interfaces in transport and middleware layers.

### Architecture Context
This final story completes the transformation by ensuring:
- All user-facing examples demonstrate proper cbio usage
- Complete test coverage validates callback behavior
- Documentation supports user migration from standard I/O to cbio patterns
- No legacy I/O interfaces remain in the codebase

### Technical Implementation Details
- Example code should demonstrate real-world usage patterns
- Integration tests must cover end-to-end callback scenarios
- Unit tests should verify both success and error callback paths
- Documentation must provide clear migration guidance
- Performance characteristics should be documented and validated

### File Locations
Primary files to modify:
- `examples/demo1/main.go` - Demo example application
- `integration_test.go` - Integration test suite
- `transport_test.go` - Transport layer unit tests
- `middleware_test.go` - Middleware unit tests
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `cbio/README.md` - cbio package documentation

### Testing Requirements
- All existing test scenarios must pass with new callback interfaces
- Example code must demonstrate proper callback error handling, cancellation, and configuration patterns
- Documentation must accurately reflect the new API surface and provide clear migration path
- No functional regression should occur during the transformation

### Testing
- Test file location: Same directory as source files with `_test.go` suffix
- Test standards: Use Go's built-in testing framework with comprehensive callback verification
- Testing frameworks: Standard Go testing with realistic callback timing simulation
- Integration tests should cover complete workflow scenarios with callback patterns
