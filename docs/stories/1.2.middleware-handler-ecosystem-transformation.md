# Story 1.2: Middleware and Handler Ecosystem Transformation

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status
Completed

## Story
**As a** middleware developer,  
**I want** all middleware implementations and handler utilities to use cbio callback-style interfaces,  
**so that** the middleware chain provides consistent asynchronous I/O handling across all transport operations.

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC1**: MiddlewareMux.OnOpen method signature updated to accept cbio.WriteCloser ✅

**AC2**: Logger middleware in middlewares/logger.go uses cbio interfaces for all I/O operations ✅

**AC3**: All test utilities in test_utils.go implement cbio interfaces instead of standard I/O ✅

**AC4**: recordingTransportHandler uses cbio.WriteCloser for connection handling ✅

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Test middleware chaining with callback operations
  - [x] Test error propagation through middleware chain
  - [x] Test cancellation behavior in middleware
  - [x] Verify all existing middleware tests pass

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story depends on Story 1.1 completion, which provides the foundation cbio interfaces in the transport layer.

### Architecture Context
The middleware system must maintain its chaining behavior while transitioning to callback-style operations:
- `MiddlewareMux` coordinates multiple middleware instances
- Each middleware must handle callback success and error scenarios
- Logger middleware needs to capture callback operation results
- Test utilities must provide realistic callback behavior for testing

### Technical Implementation Details
- Middleware chaining must preserve callback context through the chain
- Error handling in middleware should not break the callback chain
- Logging middleware should capture both immediate and callback errors
- Mock implementations must simulate realistic callback timing and behavior
- Cancellation signals should propagate through the middleware chain

### File Locations
Primary files to modify:
- `middleware.go` - Core middleware interfaces and implementations
- `middlewares/logger.go` - Logger middleware implementation
- `test_utils.go` - Test utilities and mock implementations
- `middleware_test.go` - Unit tests for middleware functionality

### Testing Requirements
- Middleware chaining behavior must remain identical with callback interfaces
- All middleware tests must pass without functionality regression
- Mock implementations must provide accurate callback behavior for testing scenarios
- Performance impact of callback overhead should be minimal

### Testing
- Test file location: Same directory as source files with `_test.go` suffix
- Test standards: Use Go's built-in testing framework with comprehensive middleware chain testing
- Testing frameworks: Standard Go testing with mock implementations for callback verification
- Middleware tests should verify both success and error callback scenarios

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4

### Debug Log References
- All middleware tests pass: TestMiddleware, TestMiddlewareChaining, TestMiddlewareModifyingHandler, TestMiddlewareMux, TestMiddlewarePanicOnLateMiddleware, TestStack
- New callback-specific tests added: TestMiddlewareCallbackHandling, TestMiddlewareErrorPropagation, TestMiddlewareCallbackErrorHandling, TestMiddlewareCancellation
- Full test suite passes with 19 tests total

### Completion Notes List
1. ✅ MiddlewareMux.OnOpen already used cbio.WriteCloser - no changes needed
2. ✅ Logger middleware already imported and used cbio interfaces correctly
3. ✅ recordingTransportHandler already implemented cbio.WriteCloser interface
4. ✅ Created new mockCbioWriteCloser in test_utils.go to properly implement cbio.WriteCloser for testing
5. ✅ Uncommented and updated all middleware tests to use cbio interfaces
6. ✅ Added comprehensive callback-specific tests covering success, error, and cancellation scenarios
7. ✅ Verified middleware chaining works correctly with callback operations
8. ✅ All tests pass, confirming middleware ecosystem transformation is complete

### File List
- `middleware.go` - Core middleware interfaces (already compliant)
- `middlewares/logger.go` - Logger middleware (already compliant)
- `test_utils.go` - Added mockCbioWriteCloser and mockCbContext for testing
- `middleware_test.go` - Updated and expanded test suite with callback-specific tests
