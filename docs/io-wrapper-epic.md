<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

**Template**: feature-enhancement-epic-v1  
**Created**: 2024-01-15  
**Output**: docs/io-wrapper-epic.md  

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Analysis Source
- **Source Type**: IDE-based analysis
- **Project Access**: Full codebase access with existing cbio package implementation
- **Documentation Status**: cbio/README.md exists, comprehensive interface documentation available

### Current Project State

**Project Purpose**: Go NetKit is a lightweight Go library for building network transport layers with middleware support and callback-style I/O operations.

**Current Architecture**: 
- Transport layer using callback-style cbio interfaces (cbio.Reader, cbio.Writer, cbio.Closer, etc.)
- Middleware chain support for processing network operations
- Context-aware operations with proper cancellation and timeout support
- Thread-safe implementation with synchronization primitives
- Resource management with proper cleanup

**Technology Stack**:
- **Language**: Go 1.24.3
- **Core Dependencies**: Standard library (context, sync, io, net, time)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Callback-driven transport handlers
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with mocks

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ Helper Function Addition

**Enhancement Description**: 
Add a helper function to wrap standard `io.ReadWriteCloser` instances into `cbio.ReadWriteCloser` interfaces, enabling seamless integration between standard Go I/O and the callback-style cbio system. This wrapper will provide asynchronous operation handling while maintaining compatibility with existing standard library types.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ Low Impact (isolated helper function)
- Single helper function addition with no breaking changes
- Enables interoperability between standard I/O and cbio interfaces
- Provides migration path for existing code using standard I/O

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Provide seamless interoperability between `io.ReadWriteCloser` and `cbio.ReadWriteCloser`
- Enable gradual migration from standard I/O to callback-style I/O
- Maintain all cbio interface capabilities (cancellation, timeouts, error handling)
- Ensure thread-safe operation with proper resource management

**Background Context**:

The go-netkit library has transitioned to using callback-style cbio interfaces for asynchronous I/O operations. However, there are scenarios where existing code or third-party libraries provide standard `io.ReadWriteCloser` instances that need to be integrated with the cbio ecosystem. A helper function to wrap these instances would enable seamless interoperability and provide a migration path for existing code.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: Helper function `WrapReadWriteCloser(rwc io.ReadWriteCloser) cbio.ReadWriteCloser` must be implemented in the cbio package.

**FR2**: The wrapper must implement all cbio.ReadWriteCloser interface methods (Read, Write, Close) with proper callback handling.

**FR3**: Read operations must use goroutines to provide non-blocking behavior with callback success/error handling.

**FR4**: Write operations must use goroutines to provide non-blocking behavior with callback success/error handling.

**FR5**: Close operations must be synchronous but configurable with timeout options.

**FR6**: All operations must support cancellation through the returned CbContext.

**FR7**: The wrapper must handle all error scenarios from the underlying io.ReadWriteCloser appropriately.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: The wrapper must maintain thread safety for concurrent operations on the underlying io.ReadWriteCloser.

**NFR2**: Memory usage must be minimal with proper cleanup of goroutines and channels.

**NFR3**: Performance overhead must be minimal, with callback dispatch not exceeding 5% of operation time.

**NFR4**: All operations must respect timeout configurations and provide proper cancellation behavior.

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: **No Breaking Changes** - The helper function is additive and maintains full compatibility.

**CR2**: **Standard Library Compatibility** - Must work with any implementation of io.ReadWriteCloser.

**CR3**: **cbio Interface Compatibility** - Must fully implement cbio.ReadWriteCloser interface contract.

**CR4**: **Context Integration Compatibility** - Must integrate properly with Go context patterns and cbio cancellation.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Go 1.24.3  
**Frameworks**: Standard library only (context, sync, io, net, time)  
**Database**: N/A  
**Infrastructure**: Library package, no runtime infrastructure  
**External Dependencies**: None (standard library only)  

### Integration Approach

**API Integration Strategy**: Add helper function to cbio package with consistent naming and patterns  
**Testing Integration Strategy**: Add comprehensive tests covering all interface methods and error scenarios  
**Documentation Integration Strategy**: Update cbio/README.md with wrapper function documentation and examples  

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Add wrapper implementation to cbio package, likely in a new wrapper.go file  
**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing Go conventions, use descriptive names like `WrapReadWriteCloser`  
**Coding Standards**: Follow existing project patterns, maintain consistency with cbio package style  
**Documentation Standards**: Comprehensive GoDoc comments with usage examples  

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- Goroutine leaks if cancellation is not properly implemented
- Race conditions between concurrent operations on wrapped io.ReadWriteCloser
- Resource leaks if underlying io.ReadWriteCloser is not properly closed

**Integration Risks**:
- Inconsistent behavior compared to native cbio implementations
- Performance overhead from goroutine creation and callback dispatch

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Comprehensive testing with concurrent operations and cancellation scenarios
- Proper goroutine lifecycle management with context cancellation
- Resource leak testing and cleanup verification
- Performance benchmarking against native cbio implementations

## Epic Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single focused epic with rationale

This enhancement should be structured as a single epic because:
1. It's a focused helper function with clear scope and boundaries
2. All components are related to the same interoperability concern
3. Implementation is straightforward with well-defined requirements
4. Testing and documentation are directly related to the single function

## Epic 1: I/O ReadWriteCloser Wrapper Implementation

**Epic Goal**: Implement a helper function to wrap standard `io.ReadWriteCloser` instances into `cbio.ReadWriteCloser` interfaces, enabling seamless interoperability between standard Go I/O and callback-style I/O operations.

**Integration Requirements**: 
- Maintain thread safety for concurrent operations
- Provide proper resource cleanup and goroutine management
- Ensure consistent behavior with native cbio implementations
- Support all cbio configuration options (timeouts, buffer sizes)
